# symmetrical-giggle

This is a repo for experimenting with React.

Currently I have just setup one experiment => React + Ionic.
Feel free to add your own experiment in another folder.

To test it out you may clone this repo or open it in [GitPod.io](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/kodekameratene/symmetrical-giggle)

Then in terminal navigate into run.it folder and serve the app:
``bash
cd run.it && ionic serve
``

Todo: setup config for GitPod.io so that the workspace is simpler to start.
